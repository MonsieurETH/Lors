# Lors Programming Language

Lors is a toy programming language developed as a Rust practice project. It includes basic functionality such as variables, functions, classes, inheritance, control flow, etc., and is heavily inspired by the popular book ["Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom](http://craftinginterpreters.com).

Please note that Lors is not intended for production use and should be treated as a learning tool or a hobby project only.

## Project Status

As for the interpreter, most of the tests proposed in the book have been successfully passed. There are some minor problems with two tests that do not pass (related to fields and inheritance), but they should be easily resolved. The next step is to proceed with the second part of the project, which is the bytecode compiler.

## Contributing

As Lors is a personal practice project, contributions are not currently accepted. However, you are welcome to fork the repository and experiment with Lors on your own. If you would like to make changes related to Rust usage or improvements, feel free to create a pull request for consideration.
