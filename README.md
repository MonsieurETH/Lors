# Lors Programming Language

Lors is a toy programming language developed for educational purposes and as a Rust practice project. It includes basic functionality such as variables, functions, classes, inheritance, control flow, etc., and is heavily inspired by the popular book ["Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom](http://craftinginterpreters.com).

Please note that Lors is not intended for production use and should be treated as a learning tool or a hobby project only.

## Project Status

As for the interpreter, most of the tests proposed in the book have been successfully implemented. There are a few minor issues with some tests not passing, but these should be easily resolved. The next step is to finalize the corrections for these tests and proceed with the second part of the project, which is the compiler. However, having gained valuable experience in coding a medium-sized project in Rust, I feel that this is a good moment to step back from the project and work on something different before continuing.

## Contributing

As Lors is a personal practice project, contributions are not currently accepted. However, you are welcome to fork the repository and experiment with Lors on your own. If you would like to make changes related to Rust usage or improvements, feel free to create a pull request for consideration.
